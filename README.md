# Tic-Tac-Toe AI (Minimax vs Alpha-Beta Pruning)

This project implements:
- A simple Tic-Tac-Toe game engine.
- AI using Minimax algorithm.
- Optimized AI using Minimax + Alpha-Beta Pruning.
- Comparison of performance between the two AIs.

## How to Run

1. Install Python (if not installed).
2. Clone this repository.
3. Run the comparison script:

```bash
python comparison.py
```

You will see the number of nodes visited and time taken by both algorithms.
