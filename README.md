This project implements a Tic-Tac-Toe game with an AI player using:
- **Minimax Algorithm** (optimal decision-making)
- **Alpha-Beta Pruning** (optimization to minimize the number of explored nodes)

---

## 📜 Project Structure

| File | Description |
|:----|:------------|
| `tictactoe.py` | Core logic for the Tic-Tac-Toe game (board setup, moves, win checking). |
| `minimax_ai.py` | AI player using standard Minimax algorithm. |
| `alphabeta_ai.py` | AI player using Alpha-Beta Pruning to optimize Minimax. |
| `comparison.py` | Compares performance (speed and node visits) between Minimax and Alpha-Beta. |
| `play_game.py` | Playable game where you play against the AI! |

---

## 🧠 Algorithms Used
- **Minimax**: Explores all possible moves to pick the best one.
- **Alpha-Beta Pruning**: Skips unnecessary branches to speed up decision-making.

---

## 🚀 How to Run

### 1. Play the Game
```bash
python play_game.py
```
- You play as **X**.
- AI plays as **O**.
- Enter your moves as `row column` (e.g., `0 1`).

### 2. Compare AI Performance
```bash
python comparison.py
```
- Shows the number of nodes visited and time taken for both algorithms.

---

## 📋 Requirements
- Python 3.x
- No extra libraries needed (pure Python)

---

## ✨ Future Improvements
- Add a GUI version (using tkinter or pygame)
- Allow different AI difficulty levels (easy, medium, hard)
